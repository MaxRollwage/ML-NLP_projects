# ML-NLP_projects

This repository contains an ensemble of different ML and NLP projects that I conducted in my free time. 
These are just examples that I used to learn a few concept and applications of ML techniques

The script "NLP_Twitter_FilterBubble.ipynb" conducts a simple NLP sentiment analysis on tweets from my news feed, compared to all tweets on on twitter. 
If my news feed does not represent the full distribution of sentiments, this could indicate that I am only present with a subset of information, i.e. indicating a "filter bubble". 
As an example I used tweets about Covid-19. 

The script "NLP_Twitter_Stock_dropbox.ipynb" conducts a simple NLP sentiment analysis on tweets from my about dropbox. The idea is whether the sentiment of the tweets represent 
or predict the stock market prize. Hereby, dropbox is just used as an example. 

The script "Predict_Tennis" scrapes data about historic tennis matches to identify features to predict future matches. 
Hereby, different classification approaches are compared.
